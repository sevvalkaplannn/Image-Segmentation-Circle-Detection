# Image-Segmentation-Circle-Detection

In this project my and my group project partner's aim was to make image segmentation and circle detection of the leaves pictures that we chose from Plant Phenotyping Dataset. We used k-means clustering for image segmentation and we used Hough Circle Transform for circle detection. In order to get better segmentation of the plant we tried different k values, and we selected the better result for the continuous tasks. In the circle detection part, we tried different parameters in two different images and we observed the effects of these parameters. After that we eliminated the invalid detections by using binary mask. In this report we will explain the effects of these changes on our input images.
